#All Classification Algorithms:-


I'm Planning to implement all these classification algorithms on a dataset which contains all stats of pokemons of first 5 generations!!
Interesting, isn't it? But what will my algorithm classify/predict? Well,my algorithms will predict whether the pokemon is legendary or not based on all the stats mentioned in the dataset!! If possible, i'll visualize all the results on Orange Data Mining/ Data Visualization tool for a better understanding, and it will also give an exciting feeling to it!!
Let's get right into it then!!!


1) Decison Tree:-
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes).
So, in this scenario, the class label, or the column that is to be predicted is the "Legendary" column which states whether the pokemon is legendary or not.
